  <p> Want to explore a country? Find opportunities abroad. </p>
  <p> Want to try a sport? Join a sport club or try an affordable class session.</p>
  <p> Want to volunteer? Want to start-up a business? Want to represent your course? Want to represent your University? </p>
  <p>There are countless opportunities available as a student. I find it amazing and surprising that there are so much to explore, and so much more that I have yet to explore. Although I did not really had any plans made before I start my journey in the University, I managed to pick up and explore quite a number of interesting stuff and I would highly recommend you to do so too. To think about it, many of these opportunities doesn’t exist after you graduate. In fact, the price would be much higher, the chance would be much rare, and the time available would be much less. On the other hand, if you are someone that would like to plan your career path ahead, you can even explore opportunities that benefits you particularly when you will be looking for job by the end of your degree. There are opportunities for you to learn, to compete, to polish your skills and to guide you in finding a career. Make friends, make connections, and enjoy. But don’t forget to work for your goals as well, as time is precious and the effort matters. Besides the University, there are many organizations/ bodies/ companies that offers good opportunities to students. These includes workshops, trips, work shadowing, interning, classes, competitions, and more. If you don’t know where to start, try looking into the University website (e.g. MyBristol), MyCareer, or the Student Union’s website. Plan your year and plan your breaks. Once in a while, take a break and explore a place. Some people find it inspirational.
