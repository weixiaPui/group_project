    <p> I remember the first time I saw a real-life fox. It was here, in England, a little over 10 000 kilometres from home. While foxes arenâ€™t that majestic a creature I was still extremely excited. I soon realised it was never the fox I was excited about; it was just the feeling of having foreign experiences here in a faraway land from home. I suppose that rings true for many a few foreign students, especially those who are less well-travelled like myself. In fact, some take all the trouble of coming here not because the education is so much better, but they just wanted to experience a new culture and environment. Personally, I feel that is a completely valid reason, if not more so, to travel abroad for education. I felt I have grown so much as an individual living abroad and having the opportunity to meet people of so many different backgrounds and cultures. There are those who would argue travelling abroad to study is an absolute waste of money, especially when there are some who passed up the opportunity to study at a better local university just for the experience of studying abroad. Well, to me, what you learn in class is not going to differ too much from one place to another, your classmates and environment will. Those are the kind of things that have really helped push me out of my safety zone and encouraged me to think and act in ways I would have never imagined capable if I were to be confined to a comfortable surrounding of familiar faces and culture. I do understand studying abroad may not be an option for those who are less fortunate than I am. But if you do get the chance, never underestimate the value of being well-travelled.
