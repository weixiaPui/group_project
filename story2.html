    <p> Expectations are usually set before we actually start our first day in university, be it positive or negative. Looking back to my early days in university, I can safely say, at least for me, expectations were quickly thrown out of the window. Note, I do not mean that in a bad way. Some aspects of university life are not exactly how I would envision it to be whilst other things may emerge in positive ways I would have never expected. For instance, I envisioned myself to be involved in various societies and activities, something I am sure a vast majority of those about to enter university would expect to do. University is this place that offers you a huge range of activities ranging from the extreme to the downright weird and I expected to be trying something new all the time. Initially that was true but as the deadlines come thick and fast I soon find myself spiraling into the mundane routine of just attending class and camping in my room. I actually do not find that depressing, just unexpected. On a more positive note, I did not expect to enjoy my course quite as much as I did. I suppose my point is that university can be many things for many people, and it is impossible to conclusively tell someone what to expect and what not to expect. I have met so many people who found their university life difficult simply because it was not what they thought it would be like. Maybe just expect the unexpected and prepare to be surprised. Hopefully you will be surprised in good ways but if you are not, ironically, you would have seen it coming.</p>
